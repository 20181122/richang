  <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
    through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla,
    Wa, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chancec, CO,
    Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, MM.

    I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the \
    road today:"Passing cars,When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."
    I definitely won't be passing any cars.

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
    everything packed and ready to go. Brcause I'm on a Segway,
    I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, ipad,
    digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have
    said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
